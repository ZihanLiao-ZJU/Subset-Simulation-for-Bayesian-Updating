From Likelihood to Limit State: A Reliability-Inspired Framework for Bayesian Evidence Estimation and High-dimensional Sampling

To execute the algorithm, simply run either:
1. drive_evidence   % For evidence estimation  
2. drive_posterior  % For posterior sampling

The main implementation is contained in the file:
1. SuS_Bay_Nataf.m  % Core function implementing the algorithm
